selfdestructing-cpp
===================

This is a small C++ "artwork" - classes that deliberately crash on object construction.

The goal is to create a DSL that is readable in English.

The project is meant to be a work in progress, since there are lots of possibilites of use and configuration of such classes.

Use?
----

A the primary use is (self-)education. Other uses may include debugging legacy code, class policy enforcement, and perhaps something else I cannot think of.

Test: see selfdestructing.cpp
